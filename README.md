Description:
“Find Your Way Out Mazes” is a single player maze game with one goal: to find a way to the exit point to escape from the mysterious maze. You can adjust the level of the challenge at the beginning of the game. Then, you will be placed at a random start point and you can start figuring your way to get out. There’ll be some dangerous places with some monster. If you unfortunately stepped on those places, you’ll have to battle with the monster to pass through it! Otherwise you’ll have to waste more time and face more monsters in find another way out. Let’s get started! Good luck with your adventure!


Rules:
1.	Enter the grid size that you want to play in (increase the grid size to challenge yourself!)
2.	The map with your current location is revealed
3.	Try to move by entering “upward”, “downward”, “leftward” and “rightward”
4.	After you enter a move, the map with your walking direction will be shown.
5.	If you land on a dangerous place, you will have to win a mini-game in order to pass through it. Follow the instruction on the screen. You will go one step backward if you fail to win.
6.	Try to get to the destination! (You will see “Congratulations! You have escaped from the mysterious maze”)
